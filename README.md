This nextjs-projects repo contains different Next.js projects
1. #todoapp
    This is a FULLY FUNCTIONAL TODO app from scratch. Features include
             - Adding task
             - Editing task
             - Ticking off a task
             - Deleting a task
   
     So basically, its a perfectly CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) or CRED(Create, Read, Edit & Delete) App.
        For the backend database, I chose *Supabase* free tier version. A DB table need to be created in the Admin dashboard.
        You can use Supabase provided client to manage the DB operations. 
        The App updates almost instantly for any Add, Edit, Delete operations
